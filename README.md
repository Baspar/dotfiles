# dotfiles
Dotfiles used for my Arch installation

## Usage
To install a specific configuration file, simply type:
```bash
stow NAME_OF_THE_DIRECTORY/SOFTWARE
```

## Notes
Some of the dotfiles are not fully supported (zsh/oh-my-zsh in particular).
Some tweaks are required to make it work on Linux or Mac
